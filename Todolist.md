##Have Done (Jun 11)

* Setup basic env: zsh (oh-my-zsh for users), git, tmux, python
* User management in VPS and pubkeys for logging into SSH

#Gonna Do

* Install LEMP Stack ([link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04))

* Install ss-panel ([link](https://sspanel.xyz/docs/install/manual))

* Install ShadowsocksR ([link](https://github.com/breakwa11/shadowsocks-rss/wiki/Server-Setup(manyuser-with-mysql)))

* Optimizing Shadowsocks ([link](http://www.jianshu.com/p/17522251883e))

    * Note: we are not going to completely follow this one, since there's a better way to do tcp congestion control (bbr) which has already been installed.
