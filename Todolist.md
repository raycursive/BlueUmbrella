## Gonna Do

* Install ss-panel ([link](https://sspanel.xyz/docs/install/manual)) **Not working properly due to configuration of PHP** **May be dropped**

* Optimizing Shadowsocks ([link](http://www.jianshu.com/p/17522251883e))

    * Note: we are not going to completely follow this one, since there's a better way to do tcp congestion control (bbr) which has already been installed.


* Build front-end & back-end base on vue(js) & eve(python) 

### Added Jul 11 late nignt

* Develope interfaces for ShadowsocksR many users, and maybe a front-end for later work.

    * Note: as the version of many users we have used so far is based on mudbjson, the coordination with a **real** database may be concerned as a hidden problem.

* Start to operate the service

### Added Jul 13

* Get a 404 and 50x page (Path: /usr/share/nginx/html)

* Get a favicon
